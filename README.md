This project is in its early stages, but I do have a plan for it. My current goal is to build an AI that can 
tell me if a puzzle level is possible. Using the neural network I can first have something that generates random 
levels and then using the neural network only the possible levels will be kept. The next level would be to create
 an AI that can generate for me good puzzle levels. I do not know how all of this will look right now, but this 
should be a fun project. I thought it would be fun to learn more about AI and neural networks and what better 
way than to do it myself!
